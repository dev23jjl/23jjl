  [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com)
  #description
  Nuxt is perhaps the best framework that one could choose. It's easy to use, configure, and do so much more. I would have never been able to level up on my web development skills without it.

  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  #description
  Most web developers will probably tell you that CSS is their least favorite part. It's tedious and never looks good. This is what I love about Tailwind which makes CSS super easy and it looks great!

  [Markdown + Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/)
  #description
  Easy, simple, and creative content management. As a person who has used numerous PKM tools, Markdown is like my native language. With Nuxt Content, Markdown becomes your CMS.
